# Getting Your Supabase Credentials

Based on your PostgreSQL connection string:
```
postgresql://postgres:Cilliers260589!@db.fihlfqufsltkgxbgonxo.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

Your project reference is: `fihlfqufsltgkxbgonxo` ✅

## To Get Your Anon Key:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fihlfqufsltgkxbgonxo/settings/api
2. Look for **Project API keys** section
3. Copy the **anon public** key (it's safe to share this one)
4. Share it with me so I can update your files

## Alternative Method:

If the direct link doesn't work:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click Settings (gear icon) → API
4. Copy the **anon public** key

## Important Notes:

- The `anon` key is safe to expose in frontend code
- Never share the `service_role` key (keep it secret)
- Your password in the connection string should also remain private

## Check Project Status:

While you're in the dashboard, please check if your project shows as:
- ✅ **Active** (green status)
- ⚠️ **Paused** (needs to be restored)

If it's paused, click the "Restore" button to reactivate it.

Please share:
1. The anon key from your dashboard
2. Whether the project is active or paused
