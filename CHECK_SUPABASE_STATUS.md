# ⚠️ Your Supabase Project Appears to be PAUSED

## The Issue
The "Failed to fetch" error indicates your Supabase project cannot be reached. This almost always means the project is **PAUSED**.

## How to Fix This (2 minutes):

### Step 1: Check Project Status
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fihlfqufsltgkxbgonxo
2. Look for a yellow/orange banner that says **"Project is paused"**
3. If you see this, your project is paused

### Step 2: Restore Your Project
1. Click the **"Restore project"** button
2. Wait about 30-60 seconds for it to restart
3. You'll see "Project is restoring..." message
4. Once restored, the status will turn green

### Step 3: Test Again
1. After restoration is complete, refresh your app
2. The connection status should show "✅ Connected"
3. Your progress will start syncing

## Why Projects Pause:
- Free tier projects pause after **7 days of inactivity**
- This is a Supabase limitation to save resources
- Your data is NOT lost - it's still there

## To Prevent Future Pausing:
- Visit your app at least once a week
- Or upgrade to Pro plan ($25/month) for always-on projects
- Or use the "Retry Connection" button weekly to keep it active

## Alternative: Use Local Storage Only
Your app works perfectly fine without Supabase:
- Progress saves to your browser's local storage
- Data persists between sessions
- Only limitation: won't sync between devices

## Quick Test After Restoring:
Open this URL after restoring to verify it works:
```
https://fihlfqufsltgkxbgonxo.supabase.co/rest/v1/
```
You should see: `{"currentVersion":"v1","name":"PostgREST"}`

**Current Status**: Your app is working with local storage. Once you restore the Supabase project, cloud sync will automatically resume.
