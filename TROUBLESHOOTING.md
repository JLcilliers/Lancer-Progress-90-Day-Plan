# Troubleshooting Supabase Connection Issues

## Current Situation
- ✅ Supabase project is ACTIVE (green status)
- ✅ Table `lancer_seo_tasks` exists with correct structure
- ✅ Credentials are correct
- ❌ Browser cannot connect ("Failed to fetch" error)

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Browser Extensions Blocking Connection
**Solution:** 
- Temporarily disable ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock, etc.)
- Disable privacy extensions (Privacy Badger, Ghostery, etc.)
- Try in Incognito/Private mode (without extensions)

### 2. Corporate Firewall/VPN
**Solution:**
- If you're on a company network, Supabase might be blocked
- Try from your home network or mobile hotspot
- Temporarily disable VPN if using one

### 3. DNS Issues
**Test:** Try opening this in your browser:
```
https://fihlfqufsltgkxbgonxo.supabase.co/rest/v1/
```
If this doesn't load, it's a DNS/network issue.

**Solution:**
- Try a different DNS (Google: 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1)
- Flush DNS cache: `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows)

### 4. Browser Security Settings
**Solution:**
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Check if browser is blocking third-party cookies
- Ensure JavaScript is fully enabled

## Quick Tests

### Test 1: Different Browser
Open the app in a completely different browser

### Test 2: Mobile Device
Try accessing from your phone:
https://jlcilliers.github.io/Lancer_Progress/

### Test 3: Command Line Test
Run this in Command Prompt or PowerShell:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://fihlfqufsltgkxbgonxo.supabase.co/rest/v1/" -H "apikey: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImZpaGxmcXVmc2x0Z2t4YmdvbnhvIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTU3ODA3NTMsImV4cCI6MjA3MTM1Njc1M30.NJP5ngR8Pl1b4l328fGbhCyTcxzzuGtrXF264YLlnxY"
```

If this works, it confirms the issue is browser-specific.

## Alternative Solution: Use Local Storage Only

Your app works perfectly fine without Supabase! The local storage feature means:
- ✅ All progress is saved
- ✅ Data persists between sessions
- ✅ Fully functional offline
- ❌ Only limitation: No sync between devices

To use local storage only, just ignore the connection warning and use the app normally.

## If Nothing Works

The app is designed to work offline. You can:
1. Use it with local storage (works perfectly)
2. Export your progress regularly using the "Export Progress" button
3. Import on another device if needed
